This directory contains CSS stylesheets and stylesheet modules to use for 
XHTML documents generated from OMDoc. The two top-level stylesheets are  
   omdoc-default.css  (for use in standalone documents)
   omdoc-vanilla.css   (for use in portal applications)
In your own application, feel free to recombine and override modules as it
suits you.
