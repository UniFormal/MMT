The projects that comprise MMT are
<ul>
<li>mmt-api: the main project (depends on tiscaf)</li>
<li>mmt-X: plugins for MMT (depends at least on mmt-api), specifically X can be:
 <ul>
  <li>lf: LF type checking and importer for Twelf (depends additionally on lfcatalog if the Twelf importer is used)</li>
  <li>lfs: LFS type checking</li>
  <li>mizar: importer for Mizar</li>
  <li>owl: importer for OWL</li>
  <li>tptp: importer for TPTP</li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li>X-mmt: MMT acting as plugin or service to other applications (depends on at least mmt-api), specifically X can be
 <ul>
  <li>jEdit: MMT editing support in <a href="http://www.jedit.org">jEdit</a> (depends additionally on mmt-lf)</li>
 </ul>
</li>
<li>lfcatalog: a non-MMT-related project for the Twelf catalog, which is used by Twelf (depends on tiscaf)</li>
<li>tiscaf: a copy of the HTTP server tiscaf, which MMT uses, with a couple of fixes and improvements</li>
</ul>

All projects are written in Scala and depend on the scala library. The appropriate library is provided as well. Later versions of Scala may or may not work.<p/>

If projects have branches (usually only mmt-api), their folder contains "trunk" and "branches" folders
Generally, the trunk is stable, and the branches are experimental.
