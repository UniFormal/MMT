<p>
MMT includes a human input-oriented text syntax, which is used in particular in the <a href="../applications/jedit.html">jEdit</a> editing workflow.
</p>

<h2>Structural Delimiters</h2>

<p>
The only unusual aspect of the syntax is the use of the characters ASCII 28-31 as structural delimiters.
These are usually considered whitespace, and most fonts do not have glyphs for them.
Therefore, typing and displaying them depends on the editor and font used.
</p>

<p>
The advantage of these delimiters is that they do not clash with any other delimiters used by notations, lexing rules, or external formats that are integrated with MMT.
Therefore, they permit near-perfect error recovery and make it easy to integrate different sublanguages (e.g., for comments or informal content).
</p>

<p>
Every delimiter marks the <b>end</b> of a declaration or a component of a declaration.

<table border="1">
<tr>
<th>Delimiter</th><th>Name in ASCII</th><th>Marks end of</th><th>Comment</th>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>ASCII 28</td><td>FS: file separator</td><td>document</td>
    <td>redundant if end-of-file follows</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>ASCII 29</td><td>GS: group separator</td><td>module</td>
    <td>any declaration that has nested declarations, i.e., theory, view, etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>ASCII 30</td><td>RS: record separator</td><td>declaration</td>
    <td>in particular includes and constants<br/>redundant if end of module follows</td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td>ASCII 31</td><td>US: unit separator</td><td>component of declaration</td>
    <td>in particular type, definiens, notation of a constant<br/>redundant if end of declaration follows</td>
</tr>
</table>

Note that these form a hierarchy of nested levels and that we can add SPACE as 5th level delimiter, which marks the end of a keyword.

<h3>In jEdit</h3>

The jEdit plugin provides abbreviation definitions for the delimiters.
But users can define custom abbreviations by editing the abbrev file (in the settings directory), whose syntax is self-explanatory.<br/>
The Character Map plugin can help as well.

<h3>ViM</h3>

ViM supports the insertion of control characters via the following hotkeys:
<ul>
<li>group separator (displayed as ˆ]) - ctrl+shift+]</li>
<li>• record separator (ˆˆ) - ctrl+shift+ˆ</li>
<li>• unit separator (ˆ ) - ctrl+shift+</li>
</ul>

Note that in command mode one can look up the ASCII code of a character by pressing ga.

<h3>Font Support</h3>

GNU unifont is an example of a font that has reasonable glyphs for the delimiters.<br/>
It also provides many useful glyphs for mathematical operators. 

<h2>Keywords</h2>

The beginning of a (component of a) declaration is marked by a keyword.
Keywords for declarations are usually alphabetical words whereas keywords for declaration components are usually a single non-alphanumeric character.

<h3>Other Keywords</h3>

These keywords introduce comments and metadata ascriptions.
They are terminated by GS, RS, or US depending on whether they occur in a document, module, or as a declation component, respectively.

<table border="1">

<th>Keyword</th><th>Additional syntax</th><th>Introduces a</th><th>Comment</th>

<tr>
    <td><span class="code">//</span></td><td><span class="code">// COMMENT</span></td>
    <td>comment</td>
    <td>comments until respective delimiter, i.e., neither a line nor a block comments<br/>
        in particular, declarations can be commented out by prefixing //<br/>
        whitespace needed after //
