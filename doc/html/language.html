MMT is a language for formal mathematics that pays special attention to foundation-independence, scalability, and modularity. MMT is also a sublanguage of the â€‹OMDoc format for open mathematical documents and will be integrated into the upcoming OMDoc 2 format.

The goals of OMDoc and MMT are to provide a web-scalable environment in which all mathematics can be represented in a way that supports both rigorous mathematical and logical tools as well as knowledge management services (e.g., databases, notation management, document management, change management).


MMT Language

The key features of the MMT language are

    a module system for declarative languages that combines expressivity with simplicity,
    a foundation- and logic-independent semantics,
    a design that incorporates web-scalability. 

The central concepts of the MMT syntax are

    module level declarations
        (structured) theories encapsulate mathematical contexts.
        theory morphisms translate between theories either by representation (views) or by inheritance (structures),
        styles are sets of notations to render MMT expressions for humans or systems. 
    symbol level declarations
        constants represent mathematical objects as possibly typed, possibly defined entities akin to Pure Type Systems.
        Axiom and theorem declarations are treated as special cases of symbols via the Curry-Howard correspondence.
        notations state transformation rules in styles. 
    object level expressions
        MMT integrates the OpenMath syntax for expressions but extends it with notions of theories and contexts.
        morphisms are compositions of inclusions, views, and structures and are treated like objects in MMT. 

Based on MMT, a number of knowledge management services have been implemented such as

    notation-based presentation,
    interactive web-browisng,
    MMT-aware databases with custom indexing and retrieval,
    project-based abstraction and work flows for building, distribution, and sharing,
    management of change,
    querying integrating hierarchic, relational, and unification-based paradigms,
    the universal OpenMath machine based on registering custom implementations with the MMT server.
