MMT is a language for formal mathematics that pays special attention to foundation-independence, scalability, and modularity.<br/>

MMT follows the <a href="http://www.omdoc.org">OMDoc</a> philosophy and will be integrated into the upcoming OMDoc 2 format.<br/>

The following describes the general principles of MMT. Detailed features descriptions can be found <a href="language/index.html">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
The goals of OMDoc and MMT are to provide a web-scalable environment in which all mathematics can be represented in a way that supports both rigorous mathematical and logical tools as well as knowledge management services (e.g., databases, notation management, document management, change management).
</p>

<p>
The key features of the MMT language are
<ul>
  <li>a module system for declarative languages that combines expressivity with simplicity,</li>
  <li>a foundation- and logic-independent semantics,</li>
  <li>a design that incorporates web-scalability.</li> 
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The central concepts of the MMT language are
<ul>
<li>
 documents: Documents are semantically transparent groupings of modules.<br/>
 In the simplest case, they serve as namespaces giving the modules declared in them globally unique MMT URIs. 
</li>
<li>module level declarations: Modules are the semantically relevant toplevel declarations.
  <ul>
    <li>Theories encapsulate mathematical contexts.</li>
    <li>Theory morphisms translate between theories either by representation (views) or by inheritance (structures).</li>
  </ul>
  The body of a module is a list of symbol declarations.<br/>
  The module system permits combining, translating, instantiating modules. The semantics of the module system is defined by flattening, i.e., computing the induced body.  
</li>
<li>symbol level declarations: Symbols are the smallest fragments of a document that have semantically relevant identifiers.
   <ul>
     <li>constants represent named atomic mathematical objects such as function symbols, predicate symbols, sort/type symbols, axioms, theorems, judgments, inference rules</li>
     <li>structures are instantiations of other modules</li>
   </ul>
</li>
<li>objects: Objects differ from declarations in that they do not have an <a href="uris.html">MMT URI</a>.
  They are mathematical expressions formed from
    <ul>
     <li>the symbols that are in scope (referenced via MMT URI)</li>
     <li>application, binding, and similar operations</li>
     <li>context that introduce bound variables and substitutions for them</li>
     <li>the variables in context (referenced by their name)</li>
     <li>literals such as integer, floats, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    MMT follows the <a href="http://www.openmath.org/">OpenMath</a> data model for objects.<br/>
    However, contrary to OpenMath, MMT uses formal theories and type systems that determine the well-typed objects. 
</li>
</ul>
