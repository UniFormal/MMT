MMT goes out of its way to be be generic and reusable. It does not commit to a particular that is implemented, and it does not commit to a particular application that this implementation is used for.  

<h2>Application Independence</h2>

MMT is an API and as such not committed to particular applications.<br/>

The MMT system includes several <a href="systems.html">MMT-based applications</a> that yield, e.g., build tools for MMT archives, a jEdit-based text editor, or a web server for MMT content.

<h2>Logic Independence</h2>

MMT is logic-independent, i.e., it is not commited to a particular logic.<br/>
Therefore, MMT users have to define their logic in MMT or work import a logic defined by someone else.<br/>
MMT beginners should check out the following two MMT archives
<ul>
<li>svn co ​https://tntbase.mathweb.org/repos/oaff/urtheories<br/>
    This archive defines several basic languages, in particular the logical framework LF.
</li>
<li>svn co ​https://tntbase.mathweb.org/repos/oaff/empty-archive<br/>
This is an example archive that uses LF to define some logics. It include a sample startup file that can be used to load these two archives.
</li>
</ul>
