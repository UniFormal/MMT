MMT does not provide a special configuration interface.<br/>

Instead, everything that can be configured is exposed as a an MMT <a href="applications/shell.html">shell</a> command.<br/>

Therefore, any configuration can be achieved by writing and a MMT shell script and loading it.<br/>

Because MMT shell files can include each other, this has the advantage that configurations files are automatically modular.
