<p>
MMT archives correspond to software projects and provide project-oriented work flow for any language defined in MMT.<br/>
They are the primary means to maintain and distribute MMT content.
</p>

<p>
A number of MMT archives are described <a href="content.html">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>Writing Archives</h2>

<p>
To write an MMT archive, check out https://tntbase.mathweb.org/repos/oaff/empty-archive to obtain an empty example archive to play with and adapt.
</p>

<p>
Archives can be written in any syntax that MMT can understand natively or import.<br/>

The <a href="applications/jedit.html">MMT IDE</a> based on jEdit can be used well to write archives in MMT's native text syntax.<br/>

The MMT <a href="applications/build.html">build tool</a> can be used to build MMT archives.
This is necessary to make the content available to othe MMT applications.<br/>
</p>

<p>
The following folders of an archivehave a special meaning to MMT:
<table border="1">
<tr><th>Folder</th><th>Content</th></tr>
<tr><td>source</td><td>the primary content of the archive in some format that MMT understands natively</td></tr>
<tr><td>content</td><td>index of all modules (produced by the build tool)</td></tr>
<tr><td>narration</td><td>index of all documents (produced by the build tool)</td></tr>
<tr><td>relational</td><td>the relational index with respect to the MMT ontology</td></tr>
<tr><td>export</td><td>default location for all exports built by MMT, each export should use a separate subdirectory</td></tr>
</table>

<h2>Manifest</h2>

MMT archives are inspired by Java archives (which are directory trees zipped into jar files).
In particular, there must be a <span class="code">META-INF</span> directory containing <span class="code">a MANIFEST.MF</span> file.<br/>

The manifest contains a list of key-value pairs.
The syntax is one <span class="code">key : value</span> instance per line.<br/>

Archive and application developers are free to introduce keys as they see fit as long as the key contains a <span class="code">.</span> character. (It is recommended to use URIs, e.g., <span class="code">org.mytool.mmt</span> for user-defined keys.<br/>

The following keys are predefined by MMT:
<table border="1">
<tr><th>Key(s)</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td>id</td><td>unique identifier of the archive, used to refer to the archive in <a href="applications/shell.html">shell</a> commands</td></tr>
<tr><td>content-base</td><td>the default namespace in place when entering a source file; this only affects the MMT URIs of the modules in these source files</td></tr>
<tr><td>narration-base</td><td>the URI prefix prepended to the file paths inside the archives to form document URIs</td></tr>
<tr><td>source, content, narration, relational</td><td>custom folder names for specific dimensions (see the <a href="applications/build.html">build tool</a> for details)</td></tr>
</table>
