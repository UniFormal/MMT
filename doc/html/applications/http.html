The MMT HTTP server is started using the command 'server on PORT' in the <a href="shell.html">shell</a>.
'server off' switches it off.<br/>

Individual services are available as <span class="code">localhost:PORT/:SERVICE</span>. These may take arguments via a <span class="code">?QUERY</span> or via the HTTP <span class="code">BODY</span>.<br/>

Each SERVICE is defined by a Server <a href="../extensions.html">extension</a>.

<h2>Services</h2>

Some services are available by default, which can be browsed in the <a href="../api/index.html#info.kwarc.mmt.api.web.ServerExtension">API documentation</a>.

<ul>
<li>mmt: retrieves the knowledge item whose MMT URI is QUERY. The URI may be followed with 'present STYLE
 to choose a presentation style. The default is OMDoc XML.</li>
<li>query: interprets the BODY as a <a href="../query.html">QMT query</a> and returns the results.</li>
<li>svg: serves the theory graph as an SVG element for the MMT document whose URI is QUERY.</li>
<li>admin: interprets the query as an MMT <a href="shell.html">shell</a> command and executes it</li>
</ul>

Note that logical algorithms like parsing, computation, etc. are exposed as special cases of QMT queries.
