4) Building archives

   MMT can be used as a build tool.
   Atomic operations include compiling (parsing, type checking, and export as OMDoc), indexing, and various exports (HTML, SVG, ...).
   
   After checking the archives from above, users should do
     run-file.sh urtheories/build.msl
   to make the urtheories archive available to other archives.
