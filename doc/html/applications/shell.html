<h2>Running the MMT Shell</h2>

The deploy/ folder includes 2 run scripts (with .bat/.sh file endings to be used on Windows/Unix):
<ul>
 <li>run-plain.sh: opens an empty MMT shell</li>
 <li>run-file.sh:  runs the MMT script provided as the only command line argument</li>
</ul>

An MMT script is a text file containing one shell command per line. (Empty lines are allowed.)<br/>
The customary file ending for MMT scripts is msl.<br/>

Users may wish to
<ul>
 <li>add the deploy folder to the PATH enviroment variable or to define 'mmt' as an alias for run-file.sh</li>
 <li>assciate msl files with the run-file scripts</li>
</ul> 

<h2>Shell Commands</h2>

The language of shell commands is implemented by the <a href="../../api/index.html#info.kwarc.mmt.api.frontend.Action">info.kwarc.mmt.api.frontend.Action</a> class.<br/>

Each subclass comes with scaladoc and can be best understood by browsing the known subclasses in the API documentation.<br/>

The up-to-date context-free grammar for shell commands is part of the constructor parser in the corresponding source file.
