<p>This is the main entry point to the MMT documentation.
The information provided here is
<ul>
<li>self-copntained</li>
<li>gradually growing</li>
<li>incomplete</li>
<li>usually outdated</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
This documentation is not linear or tree-strcutured.
Good starting points are:
<ul>
 <li>an overview of the structure of the MMT <a href="repos.html">repository</a></li>
 <li>a list of <a href="applications/index.html">applications/interfaces</a> based on or included in the MMT API - each with its installation instructions</li>
 <li>a list of <a href="demos.html">feature demos</a> including screenshots and videos</li>
 <li>a list of <a href="papers.html">research articles</a> about MMT</li>
 <li>an overview of the <a href="api.html">MMT API</a></li>
 <li>the definition of <a href="uris.html">MMT URIs</a></li>
</ul>

Disclaimer: I am developing MMT essentially alone, and I do not have the time to maintain a professional work flows for releasing, documenting, and bug-tracking. MMT is primarily an academic system although it is becoming more and more practical.<br/>
For feedback and questions, I am almost always <a href="http://kwarc.info/frabe/contact.html">reachable</a> and usually very responsive.
