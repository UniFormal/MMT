<h2>Generic Parse-Analyze-Compute-Present</h2>

<img class ="small" src="img/web-parse-render.jpg"/><br/>
The MMT parser for objects supports precedences, variable binding, and sequence arguments. Here, e.g. {} is used for Pi-binding, set comprehension, and set replacement.<br/>
Analysis infers omitted types (here: overlined) and implicit arguments (here: underlined).<br/>
Computation simplifies the term where possible (here: none).<br/>
Presentation renders terms as presentation MathML (here: displayed in Firefox).<br/>

All 4 algorithms are <a href="independence.html">language-independent</a> and fully customizable by parsing, typing, equality, and presentation rules.

<h2>Editing</h2>

These screenshots are taken from the <a href="applications/jedit.html">jEdit-based MMT IDE</a>.<br/>
Many of these features are also shown in a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdd45Uv7j_g">demo video</a> about the IDE.

Parsing and type-checking are run in the background and populate sidebar and error list.<br/>

<p>
<img class="small" src="img/jEdit-navigate-small.jpg"/><br/>
Control-hovering over an operator (here: the arrow symbol) shows its logical URI and control-click navigates to the physical location of its declaration.
</p>

<p>
<img class="small" src="img/jEdit-infer-type-small.jpg"/><br/>
Doubleclicking an operator (here: impI) selects the closest subexpression based on the abstract syntax tree<br/>
Hovering over a selected expression shows its dynamically infered type.<br/>
This works even for ill-formed expressions, which MMT analyzes as much as possible. 
</p>

<p>
<img class="small" src="img/jEdit-implicit-arguments-small.jpg"/><br/>
Hovering over an operator (here: impI) shows its infered arguments
</p>

<p>
<img class="small" src="img/jEdit-variable-type-small.jpg"/><br/>
Hovering over a variable shows its infered type
</p>

<p>
<img class="small" src="img/jedit-open-goals-small.jpg"/><br/>
The ErrorsPlugin adds special objects for open proof goals together with notations and typing rules for them.<br/>
</p>

<p>
<img class="small" src="img/jedit-complete-before.jpg"/><br/>
Context-sensitive auto-completion: Only operators whose return type matches the current goal are shown, and choosing a completion option inserts the new goal(s) automatically.
</p>

<h2>Theory Graphs</h2>

<object data="img/graphs-example.svg" type="image/svg+xml"></object><br/>

Theory graphs are layouted using <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">GraphViz</a> and served as SVG.<br/>

Here nodes of the focused document (syntax of first order logic) appear in white and the rest of the known library in gray.

<h2>Browsing</h2>

<p>
These screenshots are taken from the <a href="applications/http.html">web interface</a> of MMT.<br/>
Many of these features are also shown in a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPTzW86voI4">demo video</a> about the server.<br/>
A live instance of the MMT server can be found at <a href="http://cds.omdoc.org:8080/">http://cds.omdoc.org:8080/</a>

<p>
<img class="small" src="img/web-proof-tree.jpg"/><br/>
Two-dimensional notations: 2-dimensional notations can be given explicitly or can be computed by the system.<br/>
The LF plugin automatically adds 2-dimensional notations for proof rules, which build proof trees (including the necessary type inference of every subterm).
</p>

<p>
<img class="small" src="img/web-fold-before-after.jpg"/><br/>
Any subterm can be folded.
</p>

<p>
<img class="small" src="img/web-display-before-after.jpg"/><br/>
A subexpression's inferred types, arguments, and brackets can be displayed on demand.
</p>

<p>
<img class="small" src="img/web-infer-type-before-after.jpg"/><br/>
The type of every subexpression can be inferred on demand.<br/>
This interaction is by sending Ajax/QMT <a href="query.html">query</a> to the MMT server.
</p>

<p>
<img class="small" src="img/web-lookup-before-after.jpg"/><br/>
The type and definition of an operator can be retrieved on demand.
</p>

<p>
<img class="small" src="img/web-edit-objects.jpg"/><br/>
The MMT web server as an OpenMath/MathML editor: entered objects are parsed, type-checked, and simplified relative to the selected theory and finally presented.<br/>
While typing, the focus/selection in the source and the presentation are synchronized - and synchronization is preserved even terms are rearranged or (as here) duplicated during simplification.
</p>

<h2>Integration with other Tools</h2>

Because MMT is <a href="independence.html">application-independent</a>, it behaves very well when using MMT functionality from other systems and programming languages. 

<h3>JavaScript</h3>

Because the MMT exposes many of its API functions in the QMT <a href="query.html">query language</a> (which is itself exposed via an HTTP interface), it is straightforward to call MMT algorithms remotely.<br/>

Here is an example of how to use MMT to convert a string into a presentation MathML object.<br/>
As an extra, we use simplification in between parsing and presenting:

<pre>
   var query = qmt.present(qmt.simplify(qmt.parse(qmt.literalString(INPUTSTRING))))
   qmt.exec(query,
      function(mathml){
         // this function is run as soon as the Ajax query to the QMT server has returned
      }
   )
</pre>

This uses the qmt object, which is a part of the MMT web server. 

<h3>LaTeX</h3>

<h3>Joint Navigation</h3>

MMT provides an event listener infrastructure, which permits applications to react to content and focus changes.<br/>

IDE, theory graph, and web browser are connected so that they can control each other's focus.<br/>

For example, users can click on a node in the theory graph to navigate to its web page and then click in the web page to navigate to its source in the IDE.
