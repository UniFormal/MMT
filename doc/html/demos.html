<h2>Parsing and Type-checking</h2>

<h2>Editing</h2>

These screenshots are taken from the <a href="applications/jedit.html">jEdit-based MMT IDE</a>.<br/>
Many of these features are also shown in a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdd45Uv7j_g">demo video</a> about the IDE.

Parsing and type-checking are run in the background and populate sidebar and error list.<br/>

Control-hovering over an operator (here: the arrow symbol) shows its logical URI and control-click navigates to the physical location of its declaration.
</p>

<p>
<img class="small" src="img/jEdit-infer-type-small.jpg"/><br/>
Clicking an operator (here: impI) selects the closest subexpression based on the abstract syntax tree<br/>
Hovering over a selected expression shows its dynamically infered type
</p>

<p>
<img class="small" src="img/jEdit-implicit-arguments-small.jpg"/><br/>
Hovering over an operator (here: impI) shows its infered arguments
</p>

<p>
<img class="small" src="img/jEdit-variable-type-small.jpg"/><br/>
Hovering over a variable shows its infered type
</p>

<p>
<img class="small" src="img/jedit-open-goals-small.jpg"/><br/>
Open proof goals can be entered and are displayed using double angular brackets.<br/>
Context-sensitive auto-completion: Only operators whose return type matches the current goal are shown, and choosing a completion option inserts the new goal(s) automatically.<br/>

Technically, the above uses a special term missing(T) with notation ≪T≫ and type T. This operator is not hard-coded in MMT -- it is parsed and checked like any other constant, and its semantics is defined by a plugin.

<h2>Browsing</h2>

These screenshots are taken from the <a href="applications/http.html">web interface</a> of MMT.<br/>
Many of these features are also shown in a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPTzW86voI4">demo video</a> about the server.

Presentation is run dynamically to produce HTML5 using presentation MathML.

<p>
Two-dimensional notations: 2-dimensional notations can be given explicitly or can be computed by the system.

The notation language permits, among other things, type inference.

<h2>Integration with other Tools</h2>

Because MMT is <a href="independence.html">application-independent</a>, it behaves very well when using MMT functionality from other systems.
