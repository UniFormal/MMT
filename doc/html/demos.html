<h2>Generic Parse-Analyze-Compute-Present</h2>

<img class ="small" src="img/web-parse-render.jpg"/><br/>
The MMT parser for objects supports precedences, variable binding, and sequence arguments. Here, e.g. {} is used for Pi-binding, set comprehension, and set replacement.<br/>
Analysis infers omitted types (here: overlined) and implicit arguments (here: underlined).<br/>
Computation simplifies the term where possible (here: none).<br/>
Presentation renders terms as presentation MathML (here: displayed in Firefox).<br/>

All 4 algorithms are <a href="independence.html">language-independent</a> and fully customizable by parsing, typing, equality, and presentation rules.

<h2>Editing</h2>

These screenshots are taken from the <a href="applications/jedit.html">jEdit-based MMT IDE</a>.<br/>
Many of these features are also shown in a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tdd45Uv7j_g">demo video</a> about the IDE.

<p>
<img class="small" src="img/jedit-sidebar-errors.jpg"/><br/>
Parsing and type-checking are run in the background and populate sidebar and error list.<br/>

<p>
<img class="small" src="img/jEdit-navigate-small.jpg"/><br/>
Control-hovering over an operator (here: the arrow symbol) shows its logical URI and control-click navigates to the physical location of its declaration.
</p>

<p>
<img class="small" src="img/jEdit-infer-type-small.jpg"/><br/>
Clicking an operator (here: impI) selects the closest subexpression based on the abstract syntax tree<br/>
Hovering over a selected expression shows its dynamically infered type
</p>

<p>
<img class="small" src="img/jEdit-implicit-arguments-small.jpg"/><br/>
Hovering over an operator (here: impI) shows its infered arguments
</p>

<p>
<img class="small" src="img/jEdit-variable-type-small.jpg"/><br/>
Hovering over a variable shows its infered type
</p>

<p>
<img class="small" src="img/jedit-open-goals-small.jpg"/><br/>
Open proof goals can be entered and are displayed using double angular brackets.<br/>
Context-sensitive auto-completion: Only operators whose return type matches the current goal are shown, and choosing a completion option inserts the new goal(s) automatically.<br/>

Technically, the above uses a special term missing(T) with notation ≪T≫ and type T. This operator is not hard-coded in MMT -- it is parsed and checked like any other constant, and its semantics is defined by a plugin.

<h2>Browsing</h2>

These screenshots are taken from the <a href="applications/http.html">web interface</a> of MMT.<br/>
Many of these features are also shown in a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPTzW86voI4">demo video</a> about the server.

<p>
<img class="small" src="img/web-proof-tree.jpg"/><br/>
Two-dimensional notations: 2-dimensional notations can be given explicitly or can be computed by the system.<br/>
The LF plugin automatically adds 2-dimensional notations for proof rules, which build proof trees (including the necessary type inference of every subterm).
</p>

<p>
<img class="small" src="img/web-fold-before-after.jpg"/><br/>
Any subterm can be folded.
</p>

<p>
<img class="small" src="img/web-display-before-after.jpg"/><br/>
A subexpression's inferred types, arguments, and brackets can be displayed on demand.
</p>

<p>
<img class="small" src="img/web-infer-type-before-after.jpg"/><br/>
The type of every subexpression can be inferred on demand.<br/>
This interaction is by sending Ajax/QMT <a href="query.html">query</a> to the MMT server.
</p>

<p>
<img class="small" src="img/web-lookup-before-after.jpg"/><br/>
The type and definition of an operator can be retrieved on demand.
</p>

<p>
<img class="small" src="img/web-edit-objects.jpg"/><br/>
The MMT web server as an OpenMath/MathML editor: entered objects are parsed, type-checked, and simplified relative to the selected theory and finally presented.<br/>
While typing, the focus/selection in the source and the presentation are synchronized - and synchronized is preserved even terms are rearranged during simplification.
</p>

<h2>Integration with other Tools</h2>

Because MMT is <a href="independence.html">application-independent</a>, it behaves very well when using MMT functionality from other systems.
