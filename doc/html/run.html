<h2>Running MMT</h2>

After checking out and optionally <a href="build.html">building</a> MMT, the jars in the <span class="code">deploy/</span> folder can be run normally as a Java class.
The main class is <span class="code">info.kwarc.mmt.api.frontend.Run</span>.
<br/>

The <span class="code">deploy/</span> folder contains shell scripts that automate running MMT:
<ul>
 <li><span class="code">mmt</span> (for Unix) and <span class="code">mmt.bat</span> (for Windows): executes MMT commands and/or opens an <a href="applications/shell.html">MMT shell</a>, <span class="code">mmt -help</span> displays the available options</li>
 <li><span class="code">run-file.bat</span>: a convenience script for Windows that can be associated with <a href="applications/shell.html">MMT shell scripts</a>.</li>
</ul>

Users may wish to add the <span class="code">deploy/</span> folder to the PATH enviroment variable.

<h2>Startup Code</h2>

Whenever MMT is run, it looks for a startup script in the location <span class="code">deploy/startup.msl</span>.
<br/>

This is particularly useful for registering extensions and archives that depend on machine-specific external paths.
<br/>

Developers who run from class files instead of jar files should place the startup script into the mmt-api project folder.
<br/>

An example startup is provided in the file <span class="code">deploy/startup.msl.example</span>.

<h2>Customizing MMT</h2>

Because MMT is <a href="independence.html">language and application-independent</a>, running MMT by itself does not do anything - MMT must be customized by defining a language and building an application on top of the MMT tool.<br/>

The MMT system suite includes various <a href="content.html">language definitions</a> and <a href="applications/index.html">applications</a> to use.<br/>
See the respective pages for instructions on loading individual languages and running individual applications.
