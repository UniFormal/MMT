After checking out and optionally <a href="build.html">building</a> MMT, the jars in the deploy/ folder an be run directly.<br/>

However, because MMT is <a href="independence.html">language and application-independent</a>, MMT by itself does not do anything - it must be customized by defining a language in the MMT language and building an application on top of the MMT system.<br/>

Of course, the MMT system suite includes various <a href="content.html">language definitions</a> and <a href="applications/index.html">applications</a> to use.<br/>
See the respective pages for instructions on loading individual languages and running individual applications.
