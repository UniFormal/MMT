MMT is <a href="independence.html">language-independent</a>. Therefore, it can only do anything after defining a language in MMT.<br/>

In MMT, both languages and their their theories are represented as MMT theories. Thus, there is no conceptual distinction between, e.g., the logical framework LF, first-order logic defined in LF, and monoids defined in first-order logic.
All are MMT theories.

Various MMT theories are available. These are packaged into <a href="archives.html">MMT archives</a> and served in the <a href="oaf.html">OAF</a>.
