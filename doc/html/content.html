<p>
MMT is <a href="independenc.html">language-independent</a>. Therefore, it can only do anything after defining a language in MMT.<br/>

In MMT, both languages and their their theories are represented as MMT theories. Thus, there is no conceptual distinction between, e.g., the logical framework LF, first-order logic defined in LF, and monoids defined in first-order logic.
All are MMT theories.

Various MMT theories are available at https://tntbase.mathweb.org/repos/oaff/<br/>

In particular, this repository includes subfolders for the following <a href="archives.html">MMT archives</a>: 
<ul>
<li>empty-archive: an example archive for beginners (depends on urtheories)</li>
<li>urtheories: This defines various top level languages, in particular the logical framework LF.</li>
<li>latin: the LATIN logic atlas defined in LF</li>
<li>MML: an import of the Mizar Mathematical Library</li>
<li>tptp: an import of the TPTP problem library</li>
</ul>
