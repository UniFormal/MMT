3) MMT Archives

   MMT archives correspond to software projects and are the primary means to maintain and distribute MMT content.
   
   A number of MMT archives is available at https://tntbase.mathweb.org/repos/oaff/
   
   In particular, beginners should do
     mkdir archives
     cd archives
     svn co https://tntbase.mathweb.org/repos/oaff/urtheories

   The urtheories archive defines among other languages the logical framework LF. And empty-archive provides an example of some MMT theories using LF.  
   
5) Writing MMT Archives

   Use
     svn co https://tntbase.mathweb.org/repos/oaff/empty-archive
   to obtain an empty example archive to play with and adapt.
   
   Use 
     run-file.sh empty-archive/build.msl
   when you are done with your changes.
