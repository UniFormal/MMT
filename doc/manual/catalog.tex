All access to {\mmt} knowledge items is done via URIs, not via URLs.
Therefore, the \emph{catalog} is necessary: It maintains a translation map from URIs to URLs.
It is initially empty and built incrementally.

The most important kind of catalog entry is a \emph{prefix}-entry: A catalog entry $(i,l)$ where $i$ is a URI and $l$ is a URL has the effect that every {\mmt}  URI $l/r$ is translated to $i/r$.
Such entries are created automatically when registering an archive or explicitly via shell commands (see Sect.~\ref{sec:shell:catalog}).
In particular, if an archive is added, an entry $(nb,loc)$ is generated that maps the \texttt{narration-base} of the archive to the physical location of its \texttt{narration} folder,

Moreover, for every archive, the URI of each module in its content folder to its physical location of the module.
