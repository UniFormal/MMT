                 (\textsc{Casl}) is an expressive language for the
                 formal specification of functional requirements and
                 modular design of software. It has been designed by
                 CoFI, the international Common Framework Initiative for
                 algebraic specification and development. It is based on
                 a critical selection of features that have already been
                 explored in various contexts, including subsorts,
                 partial functions, first-order logic, and structured
                 and architectural specifications. \textsc{Casl} should
                 facilitate interoperability of many existing algebraic
                 prototyping and verification tools. This paper gives an
                 overview of the \textsc{Casl} design. The major issues
                 that had to be resolved in the design process are
                 indicated, and all the main concepts and constructs of
                 \textsc{Casl} are briefly explained and illustrated the

                 fundamental concepts of algebraic specification would
                 be advantageous.",
