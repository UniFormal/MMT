Usage: java -jar lfcatalog.jar (--port <port>)? (location|+inclusion|-exclusion)*
  
  location === absolute path to a file or directory
  inclusion === name
  exclusion === name
  name === file or directory name pattern, without its path. Star is the only special character and matches any sequence of characters.
  
  A folder is crawled iff it doesn't match any exclusion pattern.
  A file is crawled iff it matches at least one inclusion pattern, but no exclusion pattern. However, if no inclusion patterns are provided, only the second condition remains.
  The default port is 8080.
