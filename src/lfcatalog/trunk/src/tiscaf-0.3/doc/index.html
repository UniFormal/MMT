<h1>tiscaf http server, overview</h1>

<p>
<strong>tiscaf</strong> - TIny SCAla Framework - is a framework I'm working on.
The framework is written in and intended to be used with the <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>
programming language. Here a part of the framework is presented - it is an http server.
</p>

<h2>motivations</h2>
<p>
Very often a current software exosphere makes almost impossible to do things a simple way.
OTOH, if you like to spend your life dealing with extraneous-designed XML-files (rather
coding), be warned - <em>tiscaf</em> lives in another world. At any case - welcome!
</p>

<h2>features</h2>

<ul>

<li><strong>nio</strong> - nio using permits resources managing.</li>

<li><strong>full streaming</strong> - the server allows a streaming in both directions;
say, you can download and upload ISO images.
</li>

<li><strong>dispatching</strong> - requests dispatching is limited with your imagination only.</li>

<li><strong>multiport</strong> - listening to multiple ports is possible.</li>

<li><strong>static content</strong> - file system resources retrieving is supported out of the box
(with files/directories browsing).</li>
 
<li><strong>connections</strong> - persistent connections are also supported.</li>

<li><strong>output</strong> - raw (content-length is known), buffered, gzipped (as a case of buffered),
chunked - all cases are supported.</li>

<li><strong>methods</strong> - POST/urlencoded, POST/multipart (with falling POST back to octets) and
GET methods are supported.</li>

<li><strong>sessions</strong> - via URI path extensions and/or cookies are supported.</li>

<li><strong>config files</strong> - are absent.</li>

<li><strong>codebase</strong> - ~80KB in Scala.</li>

<li><strong>depends on</strong> - nothing (again: <em>nothing</em>).</li>

<li><strong>licensing</strong> - <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">LGPL.</a></li>

</ul>

<h2>documentation</h2>
<p>
The manual is <a href="./manual.html">here</a>. 
OTOH, the server using is very simple, and you can look at (the beginning of) these source
files:
</p>

<ul>

<li><span class="mono">HServer</span> - holds a list of <span class="mono">HApp</span><em>s</em></li>

<li><span class="mono">HReqHeader.scala, (trait HReqHeaderData, object HReqType)</span></li>

<li><span class="mono">HApp.scala</span> - holds a list of request handlers - <span class="mono">HLet</span><em>s</em></li>

<li><span class="mono">HResolver.scala</span> - to take an idea how the dispatching does work</li>

<li><span class="mono">HLet.scala</span> - request handler, main your work is in 'act' method</li>

<li><span class="mono">HTalk.scala</span> - main user API inside <span class="mono">HLet.act</span></li>

<li><span class="mono">HData.scala</span> - nothing interesting, just protocol constants</li>

<li><span class="mono">HomeServer.scala</span> - demo; browse your home directory (plenty of comments)</li>

</ul>

<p>
Also, README file (inside archive) has tips to try <span class="mono">HomeServer</span>.
</p>

<h2>source code</h2>

<p>
Is here: <a href="../files/tiscaf-0.3.zip">tiscaf-0.3.zip</a> (hit "refresh" if not found).
</p>

<h2>useful critics</h2>
<p>
Send to me, Andrew Gaydenko, a@gaydenko.com (please, add <em>tiscaf</em> to your subject).
I'm mostly interested in a feedback concerning tricky requests dropping a (reasonably
configured) server down.
</p>

<h2>events (in reverse order)</h2><!-- *********************************************** -->

<p><strong>2010.06.10</strong> v.0.3 is released: towards Scala 2.8. Changes:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="mono">HTracking.uriAndCookie</span> session tracking was removed.</li>

<li><span class="mono">HApp.sessionTimeoutMinutes</span> default value is 15 now (was 30).</li>

<li><span class="mono">HApp.maxSessionsCount</span> is introduced with 500 as default value.</li>

<li><span class="mono">HApp.paramsEncoding</span> is introduced with "UTF-8" as default value.</li>

<li><span class="mono">HServer.selectorQueueSize</span> is introduced with
  <span class="mono">Int.MaxValue</span> as default value to limit  nio
   selector events queue size.
</li>

<li><span class="mono">HTalk.req</span> object has helpers now to access primitives in request
  parameteres:
  <pre>    def asByte(key : String) : Option[Byte]
    def asShort(key : String) : Option[Short]
    def asInt(key : String) : Option[Int]
    def asLong(key : String) : Option[Long]
    def asFloat(key : String) : Option[Float]
    def asDouble(key : String) : Option[Double]</pre>
</li>

<li><span class="mono">HTalk.ses</span> object extends
  <span class="mono">scala.collection.mutable.Map[Any,Any]</span> now and has few helpers to
  access primirives.
</li>

<li><span class="mono">ResourceLet</span> helper trait is added. It is similar to
  <span class="mono">FsLet</span>, but is intended to access java resources (say, files
  in jars for jars in classpath).
</li>

<li><span class="mono">HTree</span> helper trait is added. If your application has (at least
  partly) tree-like structure (uri nodes correspond to request handlers), you can assign handlers
  to tree nodes in eyes-friendly manner.
</li>

<li>cleanup here and there.</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>2008.11.22</strong> v.0.2.4 is released. Changes:

<span class="mono">HReqHeaderData</span>'s and <span class="mono">HTalk.req</span>'s
methods <span class="mono">host</span> and <span class="mono">port</span> return now
<span class="mono">Option[String]</span> instead of <span class="mono">String</span>.
Thanks to Will Scullin - he has pointed me there are plenty of simplified http clients
which don't bother about <span class="mono">Host</span>-string in request headers.
</p>

<p><strong>2008.10.27</strong> v.0.2.3 is released. Changes:
</p>
 
<ul>
<li><span class="mono">HServer.stopPort</span> defaults to 8911 - it reduces implementation
code noise at embedded use cases when <span class="mono">HServer.startStopListener</span>
may be, say, just empty.</li>

<li>fixed bug preventing clean overriding of <span class="mono">HServer.startStopListener</span> - 
thanks to Damián Arregui.</li>

<li><span class="mono">HReqType</span> has new value <span class="mono">PostOctets</span>.
The value is used as fall back POST case when content type differs from 
<span class="mono">application/x-www-form-urlencoded</span> and <span class="mono">multipart/form-data</span>.
At this case concrete post data parsing is delegated to request handler via new 
<span class="mono">HTalk.req.octets</span> method. Again thanks to Damián Arregui - he
has pointed me at situations with "not too standard" http clients. 
</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2008.10.15</strong> v.0.2.2 is released - again for windows users.
Thanks to Christos KK Loverdos - he has kindly provided .bat scripts to quickly 
build-and-try <span class="mono">HomeServer.scala</span> demo. 
</p>
 
<p><strong>2008.10.15</strong> v.0.2.1 is dedicated to ms windows users. Thanks to
Tim Clendenen - he has pointed to an issue concerning windows file system and tested
a fix.
</p>

<p><strong>2008.10.13</strong> v.0.2 is released. Changes:
</p>
 
<ul>
<li>a manual was added, and this is a reason to jump to v.0.2.</li>
<li>shell scripts are slightly modified to be more democratic wrt different Unix-like systems
(my thanks to Manfred Lotz)</li>
<li>API small changes: time constants now go with unit suffix to be more self-explained
(my thanks to Henry Ware). Also <span class="mono">uri</span> method(s) are renamed
to <span class="mono">uriPath</span> to reflect reality.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm still waiting for further suggestions wrt API stabilization.</p>

<p><strong>2008.10.09</strong> As long as one of the goals of <em>tiscaf</em> publishing is a participating
in adoption and spreading of the Scala programming language, I have decided to lower licensing
restrictions and have republished the application (v.0.1.1) in terms of LGPL.
</p>

<p><strong>2008.10.08</strong> tiscaf http server v.0.1 is published in terms of GPL2.
