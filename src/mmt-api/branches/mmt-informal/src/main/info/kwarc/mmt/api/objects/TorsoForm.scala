/** The torso form of a term is named akin to the head normal forms.
 * 
 *  For example, OMA(h1, OMA(h2, tr, ext2), ext1) is in torso form with tr as the torso and
 *  (h1,ext1) and (h2,ext2) as Appendages that are attached to the torso.
 * 
 *  Its torso normal form is TorsoNormalForm(c, Appendage(h1, ext1) :: Appendage(h2, ext2) :: Nil)
 *
 *  The point of the torso normal form is understood by considering a type theory, whose constructor are paired into introduction and elimination operators. 
 *  Then the torso form is a useful representation for a series h1, h2, ... of eliminators applied to a term (the torso).
 *  The torso is either atomic or a sequence of introductors.
 *  In the latter case, a reduction rule (e.g., beta) can be applied, which eventually yields an atomic torso.
 *  
 *  For example, OMA(@,OMA(pi1,c),a) arises from the constant c (of product type) by first projection out a component (a function) and then applying it to a.
