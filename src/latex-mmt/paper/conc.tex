We have presented a system that allows embedding formal \mmt content inside \latex documents.
The formal content is type-checked in a way that does not affect any existing \latex work flows and results in higher quality \latex than could be easily  produced manually.
Moreover, the formal content may use and be used by any \mmt content formalized elsewhere, which allows interlinking across document formats.

Of course, we are not able to verify the informal parts of a document this way --- only those formulas that are written in \mmt syntax are checked.
But our design supports both gradual formalization and parallel formal-informal representations.
%Firstly, it can act as a bridge technology that exposes a wider audience of authors of mathematical texts to formalization tools while retaining their existing workflows.
%Secondly, it enables exporting the high-level structure of a document and its remaining proof obligations for further refinement in a proof assistant.
%This helps synchronize and establish cross-references between the mathematical document and its detailed formalization.

It is intriguing to apply the same technology to formal proofs.
This is already possible for formal proof terms, but those often bear little resemblance to informal proofs.
Once \mmt supports a language for structured proofs, that could be used to write formal proofs in \mmttex.
Morever, future work could apply \mmt as a middleware between \latex and other tools, e.g., \mmt could run a computation through a computer algebra system to verify a computation in \latex.
