mmt-api, trunk: maintained by Florian
mmt-api, informal: Mihnea's branch for experimentation, should be deleted as soon as the ideas are integrated into the trunk
mmt-api, next-version: Alin's old branch, read-only, should be deleted

projects that use mmt-api trunk and that Florian actively maintains (They should always compile.)
