I am Fortune's fool

I am not in the roll of common men

I am the very pink of courtesy
I am too old to learn

It is a custom More honoured in the breach than the observance
it is a long lane that has no turning
It is a wise father that knows his own child
it is better to give than to receive
it is better to travel hopefully than to arrive
It is meat and drink to me to see a clown
it is never too late to learn
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder
it'll
it never rains but it pours
Ito
It out-herods Herod
its
it's a fair cop
it's a free country
it's a long lane that has no turning
It's a Long Way to Tipperary
it's an ill wind that blows nobody any good
it's a small world
It's A Wonderful Life
its days are numbered
it's easy to be wise after the event
itself
it's no use crying over spilt milk
it stands to reason
It's That Man Again
itsy-bitsy
it takes all sorts to make a world
it takes two to tango
itty-bitty
It was a Lover and His Lass
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times
It was the owl that shrieked
It was the owl that shrieked, the fatal bellman
