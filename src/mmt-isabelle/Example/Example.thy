section \<open>Cantor's Theorem\<close>

subsection \<open>Mathematical statement and proof\<close>

text \<open>
  Cantor's Theorem states that there is no surjection from
  a set to its powerset.  The proof works by diagonalization.  E.g.\ see

theorem Cantor: "\<nexists>f :: 'a \<Rightarrow> 'a set. \<forall>A. \<exists>x. A = f x"
proof
  assume "\<exists>f :: 'a \<Rightarrow> 'a set. \<forall>A. \<exists>x. A = f x"
  then obtain f :: "'a \<Rightarrow> 'a set" where *: "\<forall>A. \<exists>x. A = f x" ..
  let ?D = "{x. x \<notin> f x}"
  from * obtain a where "?D = f a" by blast
  moreover have "a \<in> ?D \<longleftrightarrow> a \<notin> f a" by blast
  ultimately show False by blast

subsection \<open>Elementary version in higher-order predicate logic\<close>

text \<open>
  The subsequent formulation bypasses set notation of HOL; it uses elementary
  \<open>\<lambda>\<close>-calculus and predicate logic, with standard introduction and elimination
  rules. This also shows that the proof does not require classical reasoning.
